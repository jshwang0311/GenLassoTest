Title: GenLasso for Rank-deficient Design Matrices
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jaesung Hwang, Yongdai Kim
Maintainer: Jaesung Hwang <postechiminuru@gmail.com>
Description: Compute the Exact Solution Path of generalized lasso problems for rank-deficient design matrices. For some specific penalty matrices, e.g. fused lasso, which contains lasso penalty, we implement two functions. One is to find a minimal (or/and) maximal l1 norm solution and the other is to find a maximal l infinity norm solution.
